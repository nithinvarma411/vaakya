"""
Comprehensive Test Suite for WorkingAgent Chat Interface

This test verifies that the chat interface can properly understand natural language
queries and trigger the correct AI functions across all three operation categories:
- File Operations (list, create, read, write)  
- App Operations (launch applications with fuzzy search)
- Web Operations (search web, news, images, videos)

The test ensures the agent works end-to-end through the chat interface.
